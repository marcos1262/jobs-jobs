## Note: all of the config entries below are just examples with placeholders. Be sure to edit and adjust to your needs when uncommenting.

## In case your config entries all use a common input/output parent directory, you can specify those here.
##   Every input/output paths in the rest of the config will then be expressed relative to these.
##   Those two top-level keys are optional and default to "." (the directory of the config file).
# input_dir: MyLib/Sources/
# output_dir: MyLib/Generated/


## Generate constants for your localized strings.
##   Be sure that SwiftGen only parses ONE locale (typically Base.lproj, or en.lproj, or whichever your development region is); otherwise it will generate the same keys multiple times.
##   SwiftGen will parse all `.strings` files found in that folder.
